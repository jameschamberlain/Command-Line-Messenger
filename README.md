Command-Line-Messenger
===================================
A command-line messenger application created in my first year of university.
It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and send
messages to each other. The system allows logging in and registering
through the use of a username. Messages are also stored and can be viewed
by the user.

This project was given as an assignment in my first year at university.
